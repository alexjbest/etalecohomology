<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>
<p>Letâ€™s start with an example. Consider the polynomial [F(x, t) = x^2 + b(t)x + c(t)k[x,t]] for some field (k). This defines a curve (CA^2), and projecting to the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-coordinate gives a morphism [f:CA^1.]</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: where does (f) ramify? I.e., where does (f) have a double root?</p>
<p>If ((k)2), then we can just use the quadratic formula. The roots of (F(x, )) are given by [,] so there is a double root exactly when (b(t) = 4c(t)). When (k) is algebraically closed and (b) and (c) are linearly independent (e.g., have different degrees!), this is guaranteed.</p>
<p>But what happens when ((k)=2)?</p>
