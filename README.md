Etale cohomology
================

Here is our note site. We are following the framework established for our [online courses](maxlieblich.github.io/math126), in part to exercise it and find the common core. This also means that *you*, the students, can fork this, edit it, expand on it, and contribute your understanding back to the repository.

This is an experiment that might end horribly.
